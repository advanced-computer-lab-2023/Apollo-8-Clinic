[![Node.js Package](https://github.com/advanced-computer-lab-2023/Apollo-8-Clinic/actions/workflows/NodePackage.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/advanced-computer-lab-2023/Apollo-8-Clinic/actions/workflows/NodePackage.yml)

- The project is currently in development.
- The admin panel requires modifications for managing health packages while the patient is subscribed.
- The frontend needs to display more feedback messages such as "Your request has been submitted successfully".
- The testing technique needs improvement. Plan to create Jest test files and enable them as workflows for more robust and efficient testing.
- Future improvements:
  - Implement a caching layer to improve application performance.
  - Integrate a message broker to handle asynchronous tasks such as sending emails and notifications.

#### register for a new user:
```
//create a new user and save it in our database

 const user = new UserModel({ username, password, type });
 await user.save();
```
#### login:
```
  //get user's information and compare it with the given

  const { name,  password } = req.body;
  const user=await UserModel.findOne({username:name});
  const passwordMatch=await bcrypt.compare(password,user.password);

  //create a token for the user and send t to his browser page 

  const token = createToken(user.username);
  res.cookie('jwt', token, { httpOnly: true, maxAge: maxAge * 1000 });
  return res.status(201).json({token:token})
```

#### book an appointment:
```
  //create a new appointment

  const appointment = new AppointmentModel({doctorId,patientId,date,status,type});

  //update and save the doctor's schedule

    const updatedDoctor = await DoctorModel.findOneAndUpdate(
      { "_id": doctorId },
      { $pull: { availableSlots: date } },
      { new: true } 
    );

  //save the appointment

  await appointment.save();

```

  //get patient's information for thet database 

  const patientId = req.params.patientId;
  const patient = await PatientModel.findOne({ user: res.locals.userId });

  //send back the health_records

  const patientRecords = patient.health_records;
  res.status(200).json(patientRecords);
```

## Configuration

### 1. Database Connection

Before running the project, make sure to set up your database connection by adding your MongoDB connection string to the `.env` file located in the `server` directory. Here's an example:

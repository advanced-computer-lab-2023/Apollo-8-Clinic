 const user = new UserModel({ username, password, type });
 await user.save();
```
#### login:
```
  //get user's information and compare it with the given

  const { name,  password } = req.body;
  const user=await UserModel.findOne({username:name});
  const passwordMatch=await bcrypt.compare(password,user.password);

  //create a token for the user and send t to his browser page 

  const token = createToken(user.username);
  res.cookie('jwt', token, { httpOnly: true, maxAge: maxAge * 1000 });
  return res.status(201).json({token:token})
```

#### book an appointment:
